Hi, im greensoupdev :)

Here i recopiled the prototype builds of the Friday Night Funkin' from october 3 2020 to 
october 5 2020, there are 25 builds in total, so ill list em here and put their changelogs. 

QUICK NOTE:

To play these builds, you need haxe and haxeflixel and their respective tools to run it, after 
installing it all you can just run them using the command "lime test html5" in the command line, 
and it will compile a html version using node.js and it will run in your internet browser, you 
can still compile the game to windows and such, but it will take AGES to compile every single 
one of them (even in a computer with a i9-12900k with 32gb ram ddr5), thats why i couldnt 
compile everything to windows, sorry :(

CHANGELOG: 

# Build 1 - INIT COMMIT
